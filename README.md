# Earthquake-location
Repository for the coding assignment of ANM. It's a web application that locates in a map the recent 10 earthquakes of a given address. As an extra, under the map there is a table in which we can found the 10 largest earthquakes of the last year. To work with the application, we must enter the address/location, hit enter and it will show up in the map the location with the information. Also, to fill up the table of the recent earthquakes, we must click on the refresh button to have an update on the data.
